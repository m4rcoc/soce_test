* Reconsider the PRE-CONFIG existence

* Establish generic platform.vars (fixed variables)

* Isolate Netconf configuration management (soce_test.sh) as new functionalities are added for Netconf configuration

* Review/update automated_tests.sh

* Test Plan Docu integration:
    - Create a function that automatically summarizes the Traffic Flows developed with soce_generator
    - Define a dedicated section to insert a brief description of DUT_CONFIG, SG_FLOWS (using the previous new feature)
    - Create a function that export "Test Configuration Files" associated for each test

* Create a new "functionality" -> "develop" for test develop
    - When test is completed, copy all associated files and rename them with corresponding bash function/script names (./soce_test.sh init process included)
    For example:
        ./soce_test.sh export_develop_test <funcionality_test_part>
        ./soce_test.sh export_develop_test 8021qci_11_1
